# intelligent-Bridge-management-system
This software utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize bridge maintenance management.

Four X_bridge_management.py (X=A2C, PPO, SAC, and ImitationL) are used to train the decision-making agent.

The trained agent is uploaded into four files.

Using Inspection&maintenance.py and changing the agent loading path (load.(path)), the researcher can test different methods' performance.
